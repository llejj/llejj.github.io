<h1>My Portfolio</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm a 3rd year at UC Berkeley studying Applied Math and Computer Science. Here are some of my personal projects.</p>
<h3>ChatGPT API for Translation</h3>
I had a few novels that I wanted to read, but they didn't have English translations. This is a simple Python script that uses ChatGPT to translate text. All you need is the original text in a .txt file. The code is here if you want to try it for yourself. <br><br>

[insert sample]

<h3>HMM Speech Recognition</h3>
I implemented a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) based on "The Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model: Analysis and Applications" by SHAI FINE, YORAM SINGER, and NAFTALI TISHBY. Specifically, I implemented the Baum-Welch and Viterbi algorithms. <br><br>

Then, I tried to train an HHMM for speech recognition. 


<h3>HMM Stocks</h3>
I used a regular Hidden Markov Model to analyze historical $SPY data. My model had two hidden states, and its emissions were the daily price changes.

The transition matrix: <br><br>

        <th>State 1</th>
        <th>State 2</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>State 1</th>
        <th>0.975</th>
        <th>0.025</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>State 2</th>
        <th>0.017</th>
        <th>0.983</th>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
